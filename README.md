# Cycles cross product: a Jupyter Notebook
### [Vladimir V Kisil](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~kisilv/)

This notebook provides an interactive version of the paper [Ref.1](#refKisil21).

We introduce a new invariant in [Lie sphere
  geometry](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_sphere_geometry), which is analogous to the [cross-ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-ratio) of four points in projective and hyperbolic geometries. To avoid technicalities and stay visual we will work in two dimensions, luckily all main features are already illuminating in this case. Obviously, our purpose is not to give an exhausting presentation (in fact, we are hoping it is far from being possible now), but rather to draw an attention to the new invariant and its benefits to the sphere geometry. There are numerous generalisation in higher dimensions and non-Euclidean metrics, see the last section of the paper [Ref.1](#refKisil21) for a discussion. 

**Note:** to execute the notebook you need either
+ have a local installation of  [pyGiNaC](#http://moebinv.sourceforge.net/pyGiNaC.html);
+ use Google Colab and [install software](https://github.com/vvkisil/MoebInv-notebooks/blob/master/Introduction/Software_installation_GUI_integration.ipynb) in your cloud service;
+ use a [CodeOcean capsule](https://codeocean.com/capsule/7952650/tree/).
